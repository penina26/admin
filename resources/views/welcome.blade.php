     <p>CARE has been providing emergency relief and lifesaving assistance to the Somali people since 1981. Our main program activities since then have included projects in water and sanitation, sustainable pastoralist activities, civil society and media development, small-scale enterprise development, primary school education, teacher training, adult literacy and vocational training. We work in partnership with Somali and international aid agencies, civil society leaders and local authorities.</p>

	<p>CARE Somalia is currently operational in the northern regions of Puntland and Somaliland and our direction is:</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
		<li>adopt a program approach to demonstrate impact and promote organizational learning</li>
		<li>reduce the impact of emergencies on vulnerable communities, particularly women and children</li>
		<li>improve governance and access to services and resources</li>
   </ul>

	<p>CARE Somaliaâ€™s ongoing activities are divided into three main sectors:</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
		<li>Emergency Response</li>
		<li>Livelihood and Economic Development Initiatives</li>
		<li>Education</li>
   </ul>
